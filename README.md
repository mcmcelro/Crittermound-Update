# Crittermound-Update

Update of Crittermound.

Originally developed by http://www.reddit.com/user/brave_powerful_ruler.

Code moved to https://github.com/jayseesee/Crittermound-Fork/ for collaboration after his passing.

Cloned and updated by Michael McElroy. So far, I've just fixed a few spelling errors and improved the logic on assigning workers so that they'll always fill in gaps in any particular line of work before replacing existing workers.
